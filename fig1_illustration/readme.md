# Figure 1: Illustration

Figure 1 in our paper illustrates that the commonly used pseudo-AA construction (multiplying relative abundance by an independent, permuted microbial load) fails to reproduce key features of real absolute abundance (AA) data.

The datasets (`GALAXY_mOTUs_v25.tsv`, `GALAXY_load.tsv`) used to generate Figure 1 and construct the AA templates can be downloaded from Zenodo Record 14280080 (https://zenodo.org/records/14280080). You can run this script `fig1.R` to reproduce the plot.
